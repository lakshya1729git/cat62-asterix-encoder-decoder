# CAT62 ASTERIX Encoder / Decoder 

Full-Stack System Track Data Processor (EUROCONTROL Standard) 
📡 Overview -->
  This project implements a production-ready ASTERIX CAT62 Encoder and Decoder system.

  It provides:

    Binary → Structured JSON decoding
    Structured JSON → Binary encoding
    Bit-level compliant message construction
    Web-based upload & download interface
    Cloud-deployed backend (FastAPI)
    Production frontend (React + Vite)

The system demonstrates practical handling of EUROCONTROL ASTERIX Category 062 (System Track Data) — the standardized format used for exchanging processed aircraft track information in Air Traffic Management systems.

🌍 Why ASTERIX CAT62 Matters

    ASTERIX (All Purpose Structured EUROCONTROL Surveillance Information Exchange) is the global standard for surveillance data exchange in Air Traffic Management (ATM).

CAT62 specifically carries:
    Processed system track data
    Aircraft position
    Velocity
    Track status
    Identification
    Flight plan correlation data

Unlike raw radar plots (CAT48), CAT62 represents consolidated, processed track information generated by Surveillance Data Processing Systems (SDPS).
  It is used in:
    Radar tracker systems (e.g., ARTAS)
    ATC automation
    Air situation displays
    Multisensor fusion environments

ADS-B + radar integration systems

CAT62 represents the authoritative operational air traffic picture.
