# CAT62 ASTERIX Encoder/Decoder — Backend Dependencies
# ======================================================
# Install with:  pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run with:      uvicorn main:app --reload

# --- Web framework ---
fastapi>=0.111.0

# --- ASGI server ---
uvicorn[standard]>=0.29.0

# --- Multipart form/file upload support (required by FastAPI for UploadFile) ---
python-multipart>=0.0.9

# --- Standard library modules used (no install required) ---
# math      — ground speed / heading computation
# datetime  — ISO timestamp parsing and reconstruction
# struct    — fixed-point binary encoding / decoding
# logging   — structured debug output
# io        — streaming response buffer
# json      — JSON parsing

# Note on "libasterix":
# The ASTERIX binary protocol is implemented from first principles in
# asterix_wrapper.py following the EUROCONTROL CAT062 Edition 1.19 specification.
# All encoding and decoding is performed using Python's struct, math, and datetime
# standard-library modules — no external ASTERIX library is required.
# This approach gives full control over bit-level encoding and guarantees
# spec-compliant output without depending on third-party library completeness.
